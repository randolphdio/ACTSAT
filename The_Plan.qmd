### The Baseline Test

Before starting prep you need to take a test under exam conditions, so that you can monitor improvement.

Take test Dec 2021 E23 (Code 23MC1). This is the redbook diagnostic test.

Use the prepsharp virtual proctor ([link](https://www.prepsharp.com/act-test-timers/)) to keep to the proper time and incorporate the required breaks

### English round 1

It is *necessary* that every single time you get something wrong, REVIEW the mistake. If you don't get why you got it wrong, check back on the guide (<https://blog.prepscholar.com/the-complete-guide-to-act-grammar-rules>). Remember, the ACT English section is NOT AT ALL subjective---if you follow the rules you should get a 36.
