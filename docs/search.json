    "text": "Overall\n\nOfficial ACT Prep Guide 2023-2024 (AKA the redbook)\n\n\nThe argument for getting this books is to have 6 printed tests all in one place. Potentially you can find these tests online and print them yourself, but the books has answers, answer explanations and bubble sheets. Below are the test codes if you want to find versions online and print them yourself.\nTest 1: (NEW!) (diagnostic): Dec 2021 E23 (Code 23MC1) all sections (previously not in online module or books)\nTest 2: June 2017 Code 74C (Code 18MC4), all sections (Test 3 in 2022-2023 book)\nTest 3: Dec 2017 Code A10 (Code 19MC5), all sections (Test 4 in 2022-2023 book)\nTest 4: June 2018 Code A11 (Code 20MC6) (test 5 in 2022-2023 book)\nTest 5: July 2020 Code C01 (Code 20MC8), all sections (test 6 in 2022-2023 book)\nTest 6: Dec 2019 Code C03 (Code 22MC9) - (Test #1 in 2022-2023 book)\n\n\n\nEnglish\n\nThe Complete Guide to ACT English By Erica Meltzer\n\nMany people argue the Meltzer book is the best book for ACT English. It covers all of the rules with exercises.\n\n\nMath\n\nMath On The Fly ACT Book (from the basics to 30+ score)\nImprove your ACT Math score (Udemy should be around $10-15)\nThe Best ACT Math Books Ever (Good books if you are looking for a really high score 34+)\nPrepPros: The Complete Guide to ACT Math: The Best Resource to Master ACT Math (Good book if you are aiming for really high score 34+)\n\nThe free resources would and practice exams would cover everything to get a 30+ on the ACT math section. For example, going through the Reason Prep ACT-Math-Gauntlet would cover most of the topics you need (core and advanced/30+ topics). However, you would need to use other resources to work out the questions you cannot do. Preppros ACT Math Review: 12 Concepts & Strategies You MUST Know For A Perfect 36 covers many advanced topics\nIf you want a book that covers this in one place then Math On The Fly ACT Book is good. It covers all the basic topics well. It explains every topic really well and is set-up for self study. There are also lots of exercises. It also covers many of the 30+ topics so you can fill in gaps on topics that you might not have covered. Improve your ACT Math score is also a good alternative if you are a visual learner. The course has some focus on maximizing the use of a TI84 calculator (e.g. matricies, complex numbers, using graph to solve certain problems). The course also focuses on problems from real ACT exams\nThe final two books really cover almost everything in great depth. If you are scoring a 32/33 on practice tests and need more these books could take you further. They are written by tutors (Supertutor and preppros) and also have video courses associated with them\n\n\nReading\nCurrently I don’t have a strong recommendation or experience of paid resources for reading. Various strategies and tips can be gathered in the free resources.\n\n\nScience\n\nMASTER KEY ACT SCIENCE crystal clear guide\n\nThe free resources would probably be enough to crack the ACT science section. However, if you want a book that covers every type of question along with a technique to answer the question, then the Master Key is this book."

The main skill is the ability to interpret write ups of scientific experiments and articles. Time is also very tight. Like the reading it is more skill based and using practice tests to come up with the best strategy is the best approach. Again you might need to do 10 or more timed practice tests to find the best strategy. Strategies are based on getting to the questions you can get right and potentially guessing on the ones you are not sure. The Ultimate ACT Science Guide (Webinar Edition) is a great free resource and a good starting point to form a strategy. ACT Test explanations from the author of the Master Key provides video answers of a number of recent tests using the strategies described in the accompanying book."
